GitHub: @rbarrimond \ud83d\udceb robert@rlbenterprisesllc.com Professional Summary I am an applied scientist wrapped in site reliability engineer (SRE) clothing. What that means is I apply a somewhat unique data and software engineering driven approach to improving reliability in IT. I am not a full stack or pure application developer. Rather as an SRE, I leverage code-off-the-shelf and software engineering to automate tasks, reduce alert/monitoring noise, create reporting and speed responsiveness to incidents. As an applied scientist in this context, I can build the infrastructure, write the (Python) code and perform data science that gives the insights to improve reliability over the longer term, be more predictive to prevent incidents, etc. Interests Machine learning Predictive Analytics Deep Learning AI Ops Site Reliability Engineering SRE software development Projects Current Django SRE Data Science and Machine Learning Program by MIT IDSS Past IBM Data Science Specialization Course Work Capstone Project","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"Welcome to my GitHub code space!
